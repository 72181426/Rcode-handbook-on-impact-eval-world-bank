1. What do these variables measure?

dmmfd : H.H. has male microcredit participant

dfmfd : H.H. has female microcredit participant

progvillm : Dummy variable for if males were included in the program for each village

progvillf : Dummy variable for if females were included in the program for each village

2. Describe the distribution of these four variables in the dataset. 


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(hh_98.df, aes(x = dmmfd)) + geom_density()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
